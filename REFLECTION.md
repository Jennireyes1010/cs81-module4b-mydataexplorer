My predictions were correct. On days where the amount of caffeine was lower, it resulted in the focus to be higher. Something that surprised me was how high caffeine intake negatively impacted every aspect. It seems that 
caffeine is not beneficial to anything according to the data. Something tricky in this assignment was ensuring that all the data was spelled correctly and capitalized appropriately, I made a few spelling mistakes and when
I ran the code in git bash, some data reported as undefined. Something rewarding was seeing my prediction being correct and having the data prove back it up. Using my own data made this assignment feel more real and personal,
it made me more interested and eager to see my own reseults.
